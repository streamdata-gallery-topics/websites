description: Our mission is simple. We want to take modern static websites and apps
  mainstream. Because the current web is a mess. Seriously though. Every week we go
  to Hackernews and follow a broken link. 79% of all Wordpress sites are vulnerable
  to known exploits, which alone represents 20% of all website. The emergence of mobile
  means a lot of slow loading sites with towering bounce rates and loss of business
  to follow. We should do better. We must actually. Because we can. Static websites
  have always been faster, safer, simpler and cheaper. It&rsquo;s just that browsers
  and shared hosting services weren&rsquo;t good enough, so there were too many compromises.
